Default argument (don't need to specify) - WiLL NOT execute query:
exp = db.people.explain("queryPlanner")

Another argument (must specify) to get stats - WILL execute query:
exp = db.people.explain("executionStats")

Most verbose - use when want to look at alternate plans that were considered by planner but rejected - WILL execute query:
exp = db.people.explain("allPlansExecution")


use m103
show collections

db.products.find({"sku" : 1000000749 }).explain()

db.products.find( {
  "name" : "Gods And Heroes: Rome Rising - Windows [Digital Download]" }
).explain()

db.products.explain("executionStats").find({"sku": 23153496})



use m201
db.people.find({"ssn": "720-38-5636"}).explain("executionStats")

queryPlanner indicates collection scanning will be used COLLSCAN - looking at EVERY document in collection.
executionStats indicates had to examine 50474 documents, which is number of documents in collection.
executionStats also indicates only 1 document returned.
totalKeysExamined: 0 - looked at 0 index keys, i.e. no index used because we haven't created any yet.
Bad ratio, inefficient query: 1 doc returned / 50474 examined.

Create an index from mongo shell, on people collection, ssn field, 1 for ascending:

db.people.createIndex({ssn: 1})
Running above command makes MongoDB build the index. To do so, it must look at every doc in collection, pulling out ssn field. If ssn field not present on a doc, key entry will have null value.

Run query again with explain:

exp = db.people.explain("executionStats")  // create explainable object
exp.find({"ssn": "720-38-5636"}) // run find on explain object
